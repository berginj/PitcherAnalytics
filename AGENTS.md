# AGENTS.md

Instructions for coding agents working in this repo.

- Read `README.md` first for project-specific setup and workflows.
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the requested task.
- Follow existing code style and patterns in each project area.
- Avoid large refactors unless explicitly requested.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes, and mention how to run them.
- Prefer `rg` for search.
